# myhask
is a simple procedural language with only some basic things.

## Types
u8, arrays or u8. thats it, because that is the way programming was intended.

## Functions
can only return u8, and can only take u8 as arguments. no recursion, no loops, no nothing. just a simple function.

## Syntax
```
fn main(): u8 {
    rn 0;
}
```

As you can see, it looks like rust, but I don't like the -> so its ":"

return is rn, because I don't like the word return.
